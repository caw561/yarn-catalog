The purpose of this project is to create a digital catalog of my yarn stock. Time allowing,
I would also like to have a page of completed projects that are linked to the specific yarns
used. 
Having this digital catalog will allow me to quickly find yarn in my collection based on it's
specific attributes. I will be able to filter my database by attributes such as brand, color,
type, and weight. Also, I plan to include whether or not I still have that yarn "in stock" 
and I will include links to Amazon or other craft stores to conveniently order more yarn when
needed. 
This digital collection will utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
